- the definition has grown to include practices such as: agile, CI, CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, AI
- ** short history of DevOps

Prerequisites:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Can we run on Katacoda? Or any other environment?  -- Trying to work on that --


Tutorial Technology:
- Jenkins: CI/CD tool
- Docker: container technology

Steps:
1. Setup Jenkins
    a. Setup Jenkins master, with/out agents, docker-compose, etc.... Probably provide pre-canned Docker image(s)

2. Create Jenkins pipeline:
    a. Can we do this through the UI? i.e. generate the Jenkinsfile?
    b. Jenkinsfile would check-out code and run build... mention that best practice is to store Jenkinsfile in source code
    c. (optional) some tests... put results in Jenkins...
    d. (optional) archive build outputs

3. After thing summary... how this looks in a real project
